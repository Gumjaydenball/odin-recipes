        <li>
            Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. 
            Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; 
            reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces.

            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. 
            Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; 
            cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. 
            Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and basil.
